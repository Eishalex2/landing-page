# The Odin Project: Landing Page from Foundations

## Project Objective

This project acts as a capstone to the CSS module and focuses mainly on
the use of flexbox. I designed a simple home page layout, with the goal
of getting as close to the desire-outcome.png as possible.

### Future Improvements

Going forward, I would like to add and change a few things about this
Landing Page:

* Personalize it.
    * I would like to make this into a mock page for a service that
      sends an outer-space photo and a short description of it to
      subscribers' inboxes.
* Change the sign-up buttons to links so that they can actually link to
  something.
* Make it responsive/mobile friendly.
